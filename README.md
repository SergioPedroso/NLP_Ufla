# NLP Experiments

A collection of Jupyter notebooks that walk through classic and modern Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, from bag‑of‑words baselines to transformer fine‑tuning.  
The goal is **hands‑on exploration** rather than polished production code, so each notebook is self‑contained and heavily commented.
